Place your images for the player inside this folder. The folder name must be typed into the settings screen to get the game to link to it. 

For a single image set:
Inside the folder place 20 PNG images. The game will display them at intervals of five, TF leveles 1-4=1, 5-9=2, 9-14=3, etc. If you don't have 20 images, put duplicates in to get the count up to 20. For example if you had 5 images total, place 4 copies of each in the folder to get up to 20.

The images should be arounnd 300 pixels in width, be a PNG and have a transparent background.

There is a sample of how to do this in the folder "example"

For a full image relace:
You need a set of images from tf0 to tf20, bimbo1 to bimbo 5, hucow1 to hucow5 and maid1 to maid5. Follow the same formating rules as above.

There is an example of this in the folder avi porn.

The folders avi and avi porn were created by Avi. If you would like your images included in the game as optional image mods, feel free to send them to me.
