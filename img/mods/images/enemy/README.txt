Place your images for the enemy inside this folder. The folder name must be typed into the settings screen to get the game to link to it. Inside the folder place 20 PNG images. The game will display them at intervals of five, TF leveles 1-4=1, 5-9=2, 9-14=3, etc. If you don't have 20 images, put duplicates in to get the count up to 20. For example if you had 5 images total, place 4 copies of each in the folder to get up to 20.

The images should be arounnd 300 pixels in width, be a PNG and have a transparent background.


There is a sample of how to do this in the folder "example"
